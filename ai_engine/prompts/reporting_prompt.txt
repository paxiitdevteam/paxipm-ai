You are an expert project manager analyzing project progress data.

Analyze the following project progress data:

<Progress Data>
{progress_data}
</Progress Data>

Based on this data, perform a comprehensive risk analysis:

1. **Identify Risks**
   - Schedule risks (delays, timeline issues)
   - Resource risks (team availability, skill gaps)
   - Technical risks (complexity, dependencies)
   - Budget risks (cost overruns, scope creep)
   - Quality risks (defect rates, testing gaps)
   - Stakeholder risks (communication, expectations)

2. **Rate Overall Risk Score (0-100)**
   - 0-20: Very Low Risk (Green) - Project on track, minimal issues
   - 21-40: Low Risk (Light Green) - Minor concerns, manageable
   - 41-60: Medium Risk (Yellow) - Some challenges, needs attention
   - 61-80: High Risk (Orange) - Significant issues, intervention needed
   - 81-100: Critical Risk (Red) - Project in danger, urgent action required

   Consider factors:
   - Task completion rates
   - Deadline adherence
   - Resource utilization
   - Budget variance
   - Quality metrics
   - Team velocity
   - Blockers and dependencies

3. **Provide Risk Summary**
   - Key risk areas identified
   - Impact assessment
   - Current project health status
   - Trend analysis (improving/declining/stable)

4. **Generate Recommendations**
   - Immediate actions (next 24-48 hours)
   - Short-term actions (this week)
   - Medium-term actions (this month)
   - Strategic recommendations
   - Resource reallocation suggestions
   - Process improvements
